First strucure
Dimensions:

Diameter ≈ 2.4 m (8 ft).

Total thickness ≈ 11.4 cm (4.5 in).

Weight ≈ 72 kg (160 lb).

Main layers:

Sun face (front):

High-density carbon-carbon (C/C).

Coated with white ceramic paint to increase reflectivity and reduce absorption.

Insulating core:

Carbon foam, 97% air.

Very low thermal conductivity, maintains a gradient.

Rear face (back):

Structural carbon-carbon, supports loads and transmits stresses to the truss.

Structural support:

Metal truss welded at 6 points, designed to minimize heat conduction to the bus.

Thermal performance:

Sun face reaches ≈ 1370°C (2500°F).

Instruments behind the shield are kept at ≈ 30°C (85°F).

Electrolysis utilities structures-tanks:

Central cylindrical frame (titanium isogrid, 2.5 m length, 1.2 m diameter) with internal lattice pattern.

Outer carbon–carbon shell (thermal coating tungsten–carbide), conical nose shield at front.

Partial section cutaway showing interior mounting rails and fasteners.

Solar and Power Systems:

Two large foldable solar arrays (CIGS thin-film on Kapton), each 5×2.5 m, connected via articulated hinges with flexible power conduits.

Integrated radiolysis–electrolysis hybrid core near front shield: cylindrical transparent module labeled “Solar Radiolysis Reactor.”

Visible photon concentrator lenses focusing sunlight into reactor chamber.

Power bus lines shown in red linking panels → electrolysis stack → power pod.

 Life Support & Fluid Systems:

Water tank (titanium, semi-transparent, 1.5×0.8 m) connected to reactor and habitat recycling lines.

Electrolysis stack: visible PEM plates and wiring, labeled “H₂O → H₂ + O₂.”

O₂ storage pod: composite overwrapped pressure vessel, labeled “Oxygen Supply.”

H₂ storage pod: similar cylinder, labeled “Hydrogen Propellant.”

Flow paths marked (blue: water, green: oxygen, orange: hydrogen).

Propulsion Module:

Rear plasma thruster (magnetic nozzle with ring coils, labeled “Ion Thruster”).

Small auxiliary resistojet with water vapor injector.

Radiator fins surrounding engines, silver metallic with coolant loops visible.
Crew / Habitat Module:

Small pressurized capsule (2 m length, 2 m diameter) attached mid-body.

Visible interior: seat, control terminal, lighting, CO₂ scrubbers, water recycling unit.

Layered shielding (boron polymer + water jacket).
Docking & Tracking System:

Forward universal docking port, compatible with ISS node standard (APAS/IDSS).

Magnetic clamps, latching rings, and guidance cameras visible.

Side-mounted tracking arms and sensor pods (LIDAR + optical tracker) for autonomous approach.

Small RCS thrusters for fine alignment during docking.

Label: “ISS-Compatible Docking & Tracking Assembly.”
Electronics & Avionics:

Two pods:
Dry avionics pod (titanium, rectangular case with connectors).
Wet power pod (SiC MOSFETs submerged in dielectric oil for cooling).
Data bus lines (gray) and thermal lines (light blue) running along frame.

Third Shield:
Carbon/Carbon composites (C/C):

High thermal resistance (>3000 K).

Good mechanical stability.

Carbon foam:

Ultra-lightweight, low conductivity.

Allows for extreme thermal gradients.

Ceramic white coating (SiO₂/ZrO₂):

Albedo ≈ 0.7.

Reduces solar irradiance absorption.

Titanium or stainless steel:

For the support truss.

Low conductivity, good mechanical strength.
